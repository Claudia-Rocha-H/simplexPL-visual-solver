# simplexPL-visual-solver
-**In Development**-
Visual solver for Linear Programming problems using the Simplex method, built with C++ and Qt.

This project implements a **visual solver for Linear Programming problems** using the **Revised Simplex Method**, featuring a graphical interface built with **C++ and Qt Widgets**.

### Features:
- Select the number of decision variables and constraints
- Enter the objective function and constraints in their standard form
- Step-by-step visualization of the augmented simplex tableau
- View coefficients, basic variables, minimum ratio, and objective function (Z)

### Technologies used:
- Language: C++
- Framework: Qt 6 (Qt Widgets)
- IDE: Qt Creator
